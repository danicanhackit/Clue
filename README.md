# I want to like give you guys some clue
This code is kind of a mess but it is at least somewhat functional. There are lots of bugs, but the basic setup is:  
Left in yellow: your cards  
Envelope: reveal who the murderer was  
Player buttons: click to reveal their cards, only try to delete one card at a time or it will freak out  
Notepad: shows which cards you have already revealed
